# RailStrap

RailStrap is a Front-end / Back-end template using HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails (3.2.x) with a powerful authentication system for building ruby on rails websites in seconds.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/hugodias/railStrap.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/hugodias/railStrap/zipball/master)

Execute rake to create the users database
<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>

if you are having getting the following error:
`You have already activated rake 0.9.2.2, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.8.7. Using bundle exec may solve this.` try this
<pre>
bundle exec rake db:migrate
</pre>

Now start the server in your railStrap folder
<pre>
rails s
</pre>

Check at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Best pratices
---
Change the cookie secret token at
`config/initializers/secret_token.rb`
<pre>
# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Your secret key for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!
# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
RailStrap::Application.config.secret_token = 'YOUR-NEW-TOKEN-HERE'
</pre>
